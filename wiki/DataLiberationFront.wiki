The Goals of the Data Liberation Front:

 * Liberate data across web services.
 * Make that data portable across cooperating web services.
 * Allow users to own their own data which is submitted to the Cloud.
 * Do anything else to allow users to have fine-grained, easy access, and control of their data.
